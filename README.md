# Jumpway Website Version 2
Becuase the previous version was made with HTML, CSS and JS (and only had basic wireframe designing done on AdobeXD), there were many inconsistencies between instances of the same componenet, other inconsistent layout/ design issues, and would take very long to load between pages. I decided to recreate the website Figma and React JS to resolve some of these issues. 

## Main Changes
- From HTML, CSS, JS to React JS (allowed to convert page into an SPA, use of components for consistency, can now use React hooks to control the page better)
- Ensured that paddings were consistent from page to page
- Reorganized CSS files into modules instead of one massive css file for all styling
